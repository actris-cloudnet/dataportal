    <h2>Cloudnet privacy policy</h2>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
This policy describes how we, ACTRIS Data Centre node for cloud profiling (later Cloudnet), use your personal data when you visit the Cloudnet website cloudnet.fmi.fi (later Cloudnet data portal).
    <h3>Who is responsible for my data?</h3>
Cloudnet is the data controller. That means we are responsible for collecting your data and looking after it.
    <h3>What data is used?</h3>
Your IP address is recorded when you are using the Cloudnet data portal. We use IP addresses to extract metrics of site use, such as which country our users connect from, and how many unique users have downloaded data files. Processing is based on our interest in Cloudnet data spread.
    <h3>Who gets my data?</h3>
Personal data will be used for the purpose it was first collected for. We won’t transfer your personal information outside of Cloudnet.

    <h3>Data security</h3>
The Cloudnet data portal uses SSL encryption. The Cloudnet data portal servers are only accessible for admins from the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s internal network. The servers are physically located in Finland.
    <h3>What rights do I have?</h3>
    <h4>Unconditional rights by law</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to the personal data. You have the right to a copy of your processed data, so you can check the data itself.</li>
      <li>Rectification. You have the right to have incorrect data corrected.</li>
      <li>Complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint with your national supervisory authority. In Finland you can contact the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman: <a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en/contact-information">https://tietosuoja.fi/en/contact-information</a>.</li>
      <li>Object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing. The processing stops until we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing. A document assessing our legitimate interests and their relationship with you will be provided to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Conditional rights</h4>
These rights apply if certain conditions are met.
    <ul>
      <li>Erasure. You might have the right to have your data removed from our storage, for example when you withdraw consent for processing.</li>
      <li>Restriction of processing. You might have the right to have us restrict the processing of your data, for example when we don’t need the data anymore, but you require it for a legal claim.</li>
      <li>Portability. You have the right to have your data transmitted to another controller without hindrance from Cloudnet when the processing is based on your consent or a contract between you and us.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Exercising your rights</h3>
    If you have a question regarding our privacy policy, wish to exercise any of your rights, or feel dissatisfaction with our use of your data, please contact the Cloudnet team by sending an email to <a hfer="mailto:actris-cloudnet-feedback@fmi.fi">actris-cloudnet-feedback@fmi.fi</a>. We will perform our duties without undue delay within one month of your request.
